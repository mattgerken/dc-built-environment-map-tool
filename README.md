# Data Methodology for the DC Built Environment Indicators and Interactive Map Tool
The [Built Environment Indicators and Health Interactive Map Tool](https://opendata.dc.gov/apps/ce560db830634fff90933dc5664d4ebf/explore) originated as an October 2023 Data Science @ DC Hacktoberfest project. The tool sheds light on the relationship between the built environment and public health outcomes in the District of Columbia. By uncovering built environment disparities, this tool empowers stakeholders to make evidence-based decisions and drive equitable interventions for better health outcomes in the District of Columbia.

The underlying data methodology can be viewed [here](https://mattgerken.github.io/dc-built-environment-map-tool/) and the data have been published to [Open Data DC](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/built-environment-indicators/about).
